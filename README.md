Mysterium has been entirely made by @venaxyt, helped by @IDRALOU.
```
```
Mysterium usage:
- If the file to be inspect extension is ".py" or ".pyc": You only have to drag it into Mysterium.
- If the file to be inspect extension is ".exe": If you don't know how to decompile an executable Python file, so you can wait for next Mysterium updates.
- If the file to be inspect is obfuscated with Pyarmor: You put the Python file and the pytrandform folder into a zip file, drag it into Mysterium and input the Python file name.
