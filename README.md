Mysterium has been entirely made by @venaxyt.
```
```
Mysterium usage:
- If the file to be inspect extension is ".py" or ".pyc": You only have to drag it into Mysterium.
- If the file to be inspect extension is ".exe": If you don't know how to decompile an executable Python file, so you can wait for next Mysterium updates.
- If the file to be inspect is obfuscated with Pyarmor: You put the Python file and the pytransform folder into a zip file, drag it into Mysterium and input the Python file name.
```

### **All I ask is that you don't contact me for nothing, I remind you that the tool is chargeable and that I don't provide anything until we've completed the transaction, too many people have ripped me off or wasted my time, whether it's for screenshots or anything else, so I don't do it again until payment has been made. Thank you for your understanding. (Because of this type of people: https://github.com/venaxyt/mysterium/blob/main/just%20an%20example.jpg)**<br>
